# Introduction
Who I am and what I am interested in


Thank you for taking the time to stop by my github profile! 
I am a student of Purdue University Northwest, and I love paddleboarding. 

My professional aspirations include working with data and software engineering. 

I will post projects, and any contributions I ever make here.
